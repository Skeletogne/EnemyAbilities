# Enemy Abilities

Adds the following:

## Alloy Vulture Secondary: Swoop

- Swoops towards the target, slashing with it's talons.
- Will stun itself if it flies into a wall!

## Blind Pest Secondary: Thwomp Stomp

- Slams down with a poison explosion to hit targets directly beneath it.
- Enters a grounded state for three seconds afterwards.

## Clay Templar Utility: Grenade Barrage

- Launches a volley of five tar-filled grenades over cover to flush it's target out.
- Only usable if it doesn't have line of sight, and can draw an arc to the target.

## Solus Prospector Secondary: Drill Burrow

- Burrows beneath the ground, then emerges beneath it's target shortly after.

## Solus Transporter Utility: Tractor Beam / Fling

- Picks up monsters with a tractor beam, before tossing them at its target.
- Deals damage dependent on the flung monster's weight.

## Xi Construct Secondary: Core Launch
- Spins up to fire it's core at the nearest player.
- The core embeds in the ground for a few seconds, and transfers any damage it takes to the Xi Construct.
