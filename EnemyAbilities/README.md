# Enemy Abilities

This is a difficulty mod that increases the challenge of defeating the game's various enemies by giving them new skills!
Most abilities increase the difficulty of fighting a given enemy, however some abilities will open up new counter strategies! 

## Alloy Vulture Secondary: Swoop

- Swoops towards the target, slashing with it's talons.
- Inflicts Bleed
- Will stun itself if it flies into a wall!

## Bighorn Bison Secondary: Unearth Boulder

- Unearths a boulder in front of it.
- If the boulder is hit by a Bison's melee attack it is launched towards nearby targets!
- Can be launched by any attack that deals more than 1000% damage! (watch out for Jellyfish!)

## Blind Pest Secondary: Thwomp Stomp

- Slams down with a poison explosion to hit targets directly beneath it.
- Enters a grounded state for three seconds afterwards.

## Clay Apothecary Special: Tar Deluge

- Spawns a Tar Ball that it charges for 3 seconds. If it takes damage during the charge, the Tar Ball will get bigger and deal more damage!
- Creates a large lingering tar area upon landing. Deals low damage, but applies tar. The zone is larger the more charged the Tar Ball was!
- If killed during the charge, it blows up, damaging nearby monsters!
- Only usable below 60% health.

## Clay Templar Utility: Grenade Barrage

- Launches a volley of five tar-filled grenades over cover to flush it's target out.
- Only usable if it doesn't have line of sight, and can draw an arc to the target.

## Grovetender Special: Mass Resurrect

- Grovetenders passively collect gravestones when nearby enemies die.
- They then launch collected gravestones at the player, which explode into the ghost of the killed enemy.
- Ghosts provide armour to the grovetender.
- Only usable below 50% HP.

## Larva Utility: Caustic Pod (new!)

- Launches a small blob of acid towards their target. Deals no impact damage.
- Spawns a Caustic Pod at the location of impact that explodes upon taking damage.
- Deals light AoE damage to all nearby bodies (both ally and enemy!), and applies poison.
- Behaves similarly to Sulfur Pods (although deals less damage).

## Lunar Chimera (Golem) Special: Laser Sweep (new!)

- Sweeps a laser along the ground towards the player, igniting the ground.
- Ignited ground deals light AoE, and explodes after a short delay.
- Only usable below 90% HP. Has 2 charges by default. 

## Solus Prospector Secondary: Drill Burrow

- Burrows beneath the ground, then emerges beneath it's target shortly after.

## Solus Transporter Utility: Tractor Beam / Fling

- Picks up monsters with a tractor beam, before tossing them at its target.
- Deals damage dependent on the flung monster's weight.

## Xi Construct Secondary: Core Launch
- Spins up to fire it's core at the nearest player.
- The core embeds in the ground for a few seconds, and transfers any damage it takes to the Xi Construct.
